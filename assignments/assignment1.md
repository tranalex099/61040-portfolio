# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

## Domains
- **Authentic Photo and Memory Capture**: Modern phone cameras take you out of the moment instead of authentically recording it.
- **Running and Fitness Planning**: I really want to start running but I don't know where to run.
- **Reliably Waking Up**: I wake up late and find out that I turned off my alarm in my sleep too often.
- **Maintaining Friendships**: Once you leave college, it becomes really easy to lose touch with friends over time.
- **Habit Formation & Behavior Change**: I had a hard time changing my habits without proper incentives and accountability.
- **Group Media Selection and Recommendation**: It's hard to pick what to watch with friends, especially since recommendations are usually tailored to one person.
- **Match to First Date**: It takes a lot of time and effort to plan out a date when you match with someone on a dating app.
- **Local Event Discovery**: It is hard to spontaneously figure out what to do around you.
- **Local and Social News**: Find out what's going on around you and what people are saying.
- **Family Medical History Tracking**: Easily stay updated on risk factors to look out for while maintaining privacy.

### Top 3 Domains (expanded)
1. **Running and Fitness Planning**  
   I want to run more consistently, but I often don’t know where to start, where to run, how far, or what route will be both safe and enjoyable. Fitness apps exist, but many focus more on tracking performance rather than helping beginners plan routes that fit their needs. I’m drawn to this domain because I’ve personally felt the barrier of not knowing where to go, and lowering that friction could make running more approachable for many people.
2. **Match to First Date**  
   Online dating apps are good at creating matches, but I’ve noticed that many conversations stall before turning into a date. It can be awkward and time consuming to decide what to do, where to meet, and how to move from chatting to actually planning. I’m interested in this domain because it targets a very specific pain point and that can be solved and should make it easier to form an actionable plan.
3. **Maintaining Friendships**  
   I’ve realized that it’s surprisingly easy to lose touch with close friends once you leave school or move to a new city. Social media platforms help you stay vaguely updated, but they don’t support maintaining deeper, more personal relationships. This domain interests me because I want tools that help me stay close with people I care about, and I believe many others feel the same. Finding better ways to maintain those meaningful bonds over is highly important to me.

## Problems

### All Candidate Problems
**Running and Fitness Planning**
- Unclear Distance & Progression – It’s hard to figure out how far to run or how to gradually increase distance.
- Staying Motivated to Run – Without structure, people lose motivation and stop running after a few attempts.
- Customizable Route Variety – Runners want to cover a set distance starting and ending at specific points, while still having different route options each day to keep things fresh.

**Match to First Date**
- Scheduling Logistics – Finding a time and place that works for both can be frustrating and cause delays.
- Deciding What to Do – It’s difficult to find a first date activity that feels comfortable for both people and nearby that's not just food or drinks.
- Conversations That Fizzle Out – Many matches never move beyond small talk and fade before a date is planned.

**Maintaining Friendships**
- Forgetting to Reach Out – People want to stay in touch but often forget to message or call until too much time has passed.
- Difficulty Coordinating Plans – Making time to meet up in person often falls through due to busy or mismatched schedules.
- Life Stage Drift – Friends in different life stages (work, relationships, family) struggle to stay connected meaningfully.

### Selected Problems
1. **Match to First Date: Scheduling Logistics**  
   Many matches on dating apps never turn into actual dates because of the back and forth involved in finding a time and place that works for both people. This problem stood out to me because it’s both widespread and solvable: almost everyone who has used a dating app has run into issues with scheduling. I included it because reducing logistical hassle directly increases the likelihood that people will meet in person, which is the goal of dating apps in the first place.

    - Why exclude the others? I didn’t select “Deciding What to Do” because there are already many list-based resources for activities, and it may depend too heavily on local context. I excluded “Conversations That Fizzle Out” because it’s a deeper social and psychological challenge that might be harder to address directly through design.

2. **Maintaining Friendships: Forgetting to Reach Out**  
   Once people graduate or move to new cities, friendships often fade simply because no one remembers to check in regularly. This problem feels personally relevant to me, and it also has authentic demand since many people express regret about losing touch with friends. I included it because it’s a simple but powerful opportunity: even small nudges or systems for remembering to reach out could strengthen meaningful relationships over time.

    - Why exclude the others? I didn’t select “Difficulty Coordinating Plans” because it overlaps heavily with existing scheduling apps and calendar tools. I excluded “Life Stage Drift” because it’s a broader social dynamic that may be difficult to solve without addressing many external factors outside the scope of an app.

3. **Running and Fitness Planning: Customizable Route Variety**  
   New or casual runners often want to run a specific distance, starting and ending at the same location, but with enough variation to keep it interesting day after day. I chose this problem because I’ve experienced it myself, running the same loop quickly becomes boring, and it can sap motivation. This problem is attractive because it’s specific, relatable, and is solvable by dynamic route generation.

    - Why exclude the others? I didn’t select “Unclear Distance & Progression” because many existing fitness apps already guide distance increases and training plans. I excluded “Staying Motivated to Run” because it’s a broader behavioral issue, and solving it effectively might require elements beyond the scope of a single project (like community, psychology, or wearable integrations).
